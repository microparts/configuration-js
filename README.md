Javascript microservice configuration module
--------------------------------------------

Configuration module for microservices written on TypeScript. Specially created
for follow up corporate standards of application configuration.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save configuration-js

yarn add configuration-js
```

## Usage

By default path to configuration directory and application stage
loading from `/app/configuration` with `local` stage.

1) Simple
```ts
import Configuration from 'configuration-js';

const conf = new Configuration();
conf.load();

console.log(conf.all()); // get all config
console.log(conf.get('foo.bar')); // get nested key use dot notation
```

2) If u would like override default values, you can pass 2 arguments to
class constructor or set up use setters.

```php
import Configuration from 'configuration-js';

const conf = new Configuration('./configuration', 'test');
conf.load();

conf.get('foo'); // full example on the top
```

3) If the operating system has an env variables `CONFIG_PATH` and `STAGE`,
then values for the package will be taken from there.

```bash
export CONFIG_PATH=/configuration
export STAGE=prod
```

```php
import Configuration from 'configuration-js';

const conf = new Configuration('./configuration', 'test');
conf.load(); // loaded files from /configuration for prod stage.

conf.get('foo'); // full example on the top
```

4) If u want to see logs and see how load process working,
pass you logger to property:

First, install logger (winston supported bu default):
```bash
npm install --save winston

yarn add winston
```

Second, pass you logger to property like this:
```ts
import Configuration from 'configuration-js';
import WinstonConsoleLogger from 'configuration-js/winston-console-logger';

const conf = new Configuration();
conf.logger = new WinstonConsoleLogger(winston.createLogger({
  transports: [new winston.transports.Console()]
}));

conf.load();

conf.get('foo'); // full example on the top
```

Also, your can pass any logger who implements library `LoggerInterface`.
